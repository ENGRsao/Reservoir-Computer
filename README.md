# Reservoir-Computer
This repository implement a reservoir computer using Matlab simulation. It harness the nonlinearity property of optical fiber in achieving a reservoir. Optical fiber is used to serve as the nonlinear node in the reservoir and also serve as the delay loop

This research aims to develop and simulate All-optical Reservoir computing circuit by harnessing the non-linearity dynamics of photonics devices such as Non-linear optical fiber, Semiconductor optical Amplifier (SOA), in creating the reservoir.
